           <h3>Education</h3>
          </h1>
          
        <h3>Primary Level</h3>
        <p>
        I joined Arya Primary School in Kisumu where I started my class one journey
        when I got to Class 6 I got a transfer to join a private school in Nairobi where I got to learn and start a new journey in primary level.
        I later sat for my KCPE examinations and got to move to the next level
        <h3>Secondary School</h3>
        After my KCPE, I was privillaged and got the honor to join a national school. Mbita Boys High School.
        I started my form one classes and journey of another level of eduation. Life was a bit different cause here I got to do most of the things by myself.
        I still kept the best foot foward and did my best to the second and third level i.e. Form 2 and 3 
        At form 3 the nation and world at large was invaded by a contegious disease know as the COVID 19 and we were forced to stay Home
        for almost a year.
        Later we went back to school and I did my form 3 and form 4 where I sat for another national examination well known as KCSE.
        <h3>University Level</h3>
        I later joined ZETECH University to invent my future.
        I am a year two student in IT and with the joy of doing IT
        I am looking foward to do my first and second degree in IT and expand more in the field of Technology
